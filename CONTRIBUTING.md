# Contributing to IoTIVP

Thank you for your interest in helping build the IoT Integrity Verification Protocol!  
IoTIVP is an early-stage but growing open standard focused on secure, trustworthy IoT data.

## 🧭 How to Contribute

### 1. Open an Issue
Use GitHub Issues to:
- Report bugs  
- Suggest improvements  
- Request features  
- Ask questions about implementation

### 2. Pull Requests (PRs)
Before opening a PR:
- Open an issue describing the change  
- Keep PRs small and focused  
- Follow the repository’s style and folder structure  

### 3. Discussions
If the org eventually enables GitHub Discussions, it will be used for:
- Architecture questions  
- Protocol debates  
- Help with implementation  
- Integration examples

---

## 🏗 Code Style

### Python
- Use clear, readable code  
- No unnecessary complexity  
- Add docstrings  
- Keep functions pure when possible  

---

## 🧪 Testing
If adding new components:
- Include small, self-contained test scripts  
- Ensure decoding/encoding logic remains deterministic  
- Do not introduce breaking changes without discussion

---

## 🔐 Security Notes
IoTIVP deals with cryptographic integrity.  
Do **not** commit:
- secrets  
- private keys  
- device-specific credentials  
- sensitive environment variables

If you find a security issue, contact maintainers privately.

## ❤️ Thank You
Even early suggestions help shape IoTIVP into a global standard.  
Your feedback is welcome and valued.
